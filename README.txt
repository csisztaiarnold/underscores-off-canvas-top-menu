== Description ==

Wraps Underscores WordPress starter theme's header and injects a barebone off-canvas top menu for Underscores' mobile resolution (below 600px).
Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE11+

== Installation ==

1. Requires a [default Underscores theme](http://underscores.me/). Copy the theme into WordPress' themes folder and enable it in the admin area.
1. Copy the plugin's folder into WordPress' plugin directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add some menu items to the primary menu (or whichever menu you are using)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where's my adminbar? =

It's disabled as it conflicts with the off-canvas menu.

= Where's my WordPress tagline? =

Hidden with CSS. Feel free to put it back.

= How do I edit the style of the menu? =

Simply create a new stylesheet in the theme's folder and override the plugin's default styles. DO NOT edit the plugin files directly!

= The plugin isn't working. Why? =

Make sure that you don't edit the HTML markup inside the <header> tag (unless you know what are you doing). Also the <header>'s ID must remain #masthead.

== Thanks to ==

JÃ³zsef Mikus for the straightforward overflow-y:scroll hack in case the menu's vertical size exceeds the screen's size.
